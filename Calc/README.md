# DESCRIPTION
Resizing the browser (past a width of 768px) will include special buttons on 
the calculator e.g sin, cos, log etc.
Buttons present to change background color (cause its fun and because I canðŸ˜Œ)

# KNOWN BUGS
Restricting some css properties to display screens of max-width: 768px;
Had to create an alternate css file.
Clearing the input slowly and immediately (use of C and A/C)
Use of Â² and âˆš since it kept showing error on the console log (This one took a
while tho ðŸ˜­)
Conversion of sin and cosine since its base form in js is in radians (I needed it in degrees)
